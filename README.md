FlurryBurst is an extremely-fast, medium-period, statistically-strong PRNG that replaces many variants of PCG and Xorshift with enhanced statistical properties, faster generation speeds and larger periods.

`flurryburst8` is a deterministic PRNG function that generates an 8-bit, pseudorandom, unsigned integer from 8-bit state integers.

It accepts the following argument.

1. `s` is the `struct flurryburst8_s` pointer that contains the state. `a` must be seeded with `0` and `b` must be seeded with any `uint8_t` value.

The return value data type is `uint8_t`.

It has a period of between 2¹⁴ and 2¹⁵, precisely 18688, without broken cycles. Furthermore, a full cycle generates at least 1 of each number from a range of 2⁸ numbers and zeroland escapes immediately after 1 subsequent number generation.

Incrementing `b` by `2` outside of `flurryburst8` whenever `a` is `0` behaves as a jump function. Generating 73 subsequent numbers after either jumping or seeding the state resets `a` to `0`. 256 repetitions of both generating 73 subsequent numbers and jumping generates the same frequency of numbers as a full cycle that generates 18688 numbers without jumping.

It passes `stdin8` PractRand tests up to 4KB.

RXS M XS variants of PCG8 pass `stdin8` PractRand tests up to a range of 1KB to 2KB. Furthermore, they generate predictable output with 1 cycle that has 1 of each number from a range of 2⁸ numbers.

Xorshift8 passes `stdin8` PractRand tests up to 1KB. Furthermore, it doesn't generate `0` and generates predictable output with 1 cycle that has 1 of each number from a range of (2⁸ - 1) numbers.

Detailed benchmark results are coming soon.

In conclusion, FlurryBurst8 provides enhanced distribution, period, security, speed and statistical test results as an ideal alternative to RXS M XS variants of PCG8 and Xorshift8.

16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit variants are coming soon.
